// ----------
// MAP
// ----------

// A map is a generic view of a level
// Each level should have a single map and vice versa
// A map should be bound to a single root scene graph consisting on multiple sub scenes
// A scene is like an abstraction of a "local mechanism" irl. Just like how you stroll across the street and see many different things happening. Someone smoking, some mother chasing her kid, some shopkeeper cleaning his stuff. Each of those things can be incorporated into their own scene.
// If a scene would have quite a lot of affect on another, then one should incorporate both scenes into a single scene
