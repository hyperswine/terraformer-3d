# Terraformer Engine

A 3D game engine but completely in rust/std/cargo.

- Use either as a library project management system + libraries (lib.rs) or an GUI game engine system (dioxus main.rs) with everything in the libraries as well as extras

## Key features

- write interactive 3D first person/3rd person games easily for demen or eletian journey like games
- builtin VR support with `vr::` module
- range of tools like AI pathfinding, collision, physics, etc. built in
- range of libraries for common models and AI procedural level generation
- everything in rust, no need for e.g. scripting in other languages. Once you know rust, you can do anything with Terraformer

## GUI

To install T3D as a native app, just download the release binary from the github page site. For win/macos/debian it comes with a nice installer. For neutron, it's there by default when you enable the "Game Dev" option.

The example models were taken from free3d and sketchfab.  Some of them are actually really cool and contain animations. Which can be played with model.animation[i].play().
